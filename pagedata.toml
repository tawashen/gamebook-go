description = "The trees start to thin out, and just ahead you can make out the silhouette of an old log cabin beneath an oak tree. This hut seems to have been abandoned and there is little of apparent value left behind. Opening a small chest near the main door, you discover bunches of twigs that have been tied together with strong twine. One end of the bundle has been coated with pitch. They are Torches. Next to the chest is a Short Sword and a Tinderbox. You may take them and a Torch if you wish but make sure that you mark them on your Action Chart."
